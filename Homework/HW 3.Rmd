This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
abs(3* (4/3-1) -1 )

# the idea is that 4/3 gets cut off after 16 decimals. therefore the absolute value results in not being 0, but the smallest possible number. this works in IEEE 754 double precision 
```

```{r}
x <- c(0,7,8)
x[0.9999999999999999]   # the maximum precision we can expect for floating point computations is 16 decimal digits after the comma. 
x[0.99999999999999999]    # therefore r rounds this to 1
```

```{r}
options(digits=22)

ex55a <- function(x) {
  x <- 1
  while(x + 1 != 1)
    x <- x/2
  return(x*2)
}

ex55a()

1+ex55a()

ex55b <- function(x) {
  x <- 1
  while(1 - x != 1)
    x <- x/2
  return(x*2)
}

ex55b()
1-ex55b()
